# ScreenShare
It is a screen sharing application done on localhost between a server and a client. It is a one-way sharing from client to server.

Java jdk-14 and JavaFX-14 was used here in order to facilitate the use of JavaFX Robot class. It is purely a JavaFX project, no Swing or AWT was used.


## Update
I've added two more folders with the name of webcam. They use the OpenCV library. In this set of server and client, we can share screen alongside the webcam video. A new feature is, now the server can access the client monitor by clicking and type there. But still a drag & drop event is still missing. Hope to add it in the future as well as make it available for multiple clients.
